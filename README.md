# hello-world-k8s
Go server that displays a "Hello World!" message, deployed to Kubernetes. Serves as a good learning point for figuring out how to setup Kubernetes for a project. Contains a deployment, a service to expose the deployment's pod(s), and also a config map to store the port as an example environment variable.
